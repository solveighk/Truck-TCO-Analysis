## Files

The file run_simulations.py is the main file for running one round of TCO simulations. 

Infrastructure.py, cost_functions.py, energy_costs.py and truck.py are used in run_simulations and for plotting. 
Infrastructure.py calculates refueling inconvenience (RI). Cost_functions.py contains functions use to calculate capex and opex. Energy_costs.py is used to estimate charging and diesel costs. 

The folder plotting/ are used to plot the main findings in our thesis.
